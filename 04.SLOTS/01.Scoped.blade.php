// It allows you to access data or methods from the component within your slot.

// It could be achieved similarly by defining public mehtods or properties on your component in your laravel 
 
   and accessing the component within your slot via the $component variable.

// example:----- 
      * assume x-alert component has a public " formatAlert " method defined on it's component class. 

              <x-alert>
                <x-slot:title>
                    {{ $component->formatAlert('Server Error')}}
                </x-slot>
                
                <strong>Whoops!</strong>Something went wrong!

               </x-alert>
